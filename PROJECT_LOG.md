# Project Development Log

This document summarizes the key steps and actions taken during the development of the Pothole Segmentation project, facilitated by a Gemini-powered CLI agent.

## 1. Initial Project Analysis and Setup

-   **Date:** Monday, June 30, 2025

-   **Observation:** Project aims for pothole segmentation using `ultralytics` (YOLOv8) with COCO-formatted data. `src/` directory was empty, indicating the next step was model building and training.

## 2. Data Configuration and Annotation Conversion

-   **Action:** Identified the need for a `data.yaml` configuration file for `ultralytics`.
-   **Action:** Searched for `ultralytics yolov8 coco dataset format` to understand the required YAML structure.
-   **Action:** Read `data/train/_annotations.coco.json` to extract class names (identified "pothole" as the single class).
-   **Action:** Created `data/data.yaml` with initial paths:
    ```yaml
    path: ../data
    train: train
    val: valid

    names:
      0: pothole
    ```
-   **Action:** Created `src/convert_annotations.py` to convert COCO annotations to YOLO format using `ultralytics.data.converter.convert_coco`.
-   **Action:** Created `src/custom_coco_to_yolo.py` based on external resources to perform a robust COCO to YOLO segmentation conversion.
-   **Action:** Executed `src/custom_coco_to_yolo.py` successfully.

## 3. Data Reorganization for Training

-   **Observation:** `ultralytics` expects images in an `images/` subdirectory within `train/` and `valid/`.
-   **Action:** Created `data/train/images/` and `data/valid/images/` directories.
-   **Action:** Moved all `.jpg` image files from `data/train/` to `data/train/images/`.
-   **Action:** Moved all `.jpg` image files from `data/valid/` to `data/valid/images/`.
-   **Action:** Updated `data/data.yaml` to reflect the new image paths:
    ```yaml
    path: ../data
    train: train/images
    val: valid/images

    names:
      0: pothole
    ```

## 4. Model Training

-   **Action:** Created `src/train_model.py` to train a YOLOv8n segmentation model.
-   **Action:** Executed `src/train_model.py` using the correct Python executable.
-   **Observation:** Training completed successfully after resolving data path and conversion issues.
-   **Result:** Trained model weights saved to `runs/segment/train2/weights/best.pt`.
